**Saúva** is a high-performance Python framework designed for atomistic simulations powered by active machine learning interatomic potentials. It streamlines the integration of first-principles accuracy with the efficiency of classical force fields, enabling the automated development of robust potentials during the simulation process.

**Key Features**

* **On-the-Fly Training**: Automate the training cycle during simulations, reducing the need for manual dataset curation and ensuring the potential is accurate for the relevant phase space.


* **Diverse Configuration Sampling**: Generate new training structures through multiple pathways:

  - **Random Displacements**: Introduce displacements in atomic positions and lattices randomly using "Normal" or "Uniform" distributions.

  - **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**: Structural exploration via various ensembles, such as NVT or NPT.

  - **Minimum Energy Paths (MEP)**: Sampling through diffusion paths and transition states, using methods like Nudged Elastic Band (NEB), getting configurations along reaction coordinates for rare event sampling. 


* **Active Learning & Uncertainty Quantification**: Utilize Machine Learning Committees (ensembles) to identify configurations with high model disagreement, targeting high-uncertainty regions for further training.


* **Scalable Sample Generation**: Efficiently produce large-scale datasets for ML training through continuous random displacements or extended MD trajectories.

**Core Focus**

The hallmark of Carcará is its optimization for continuous, autonomous model evolution. Whether you are running long-scale molecular dynamics or generating vast structural libraries via random displacements, Carcará ensures that your machine learning model adapts to the chemical environment in real-time, significantly lowering the barrier for complex materials modeling.
